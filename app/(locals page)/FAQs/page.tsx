                Libraries are independent. You can use Postgres instead of
                MongoDB for instance.

            <div className="collapse-content">
              <p>
                It's more than just a template. You can copy/paste sections to
                build your site quickly, like a pricing section, an FAQ, and
                even an entire blog. You also get a bunch of UI components like
                buttons, modals, popovers, etc.
              </p>

                The NextJS starter also comes with handy tools you need to run
                an online businessâ€”payment processing, emails, SEO, etc.
